# Formatting Notes
___

Relanota supports a subset of the Markdown language.
This page gives you an overview of the supported syntax, and how it can format your notes.

## Italics

To write text in italics, soround the text with a single asterisk (\*).
This will put the text in italics mode, and text written between the asterisks will be formatted in italics in the text view.

```
This text is *italics*.
```

This text is *italics*.

## Bold

To write text in bold, soround the text with two asterisks (\*\*).
This will put the text in bold mode, and the text written, will be formatted in bold.

```
This text is **bold**.
```

This text is **bold**.

## Bold and Italics

Text can also be formatted as both Bold and Italics at the same time.
This is acheived by sorounding the text with three asterisks (\*\*\*).

```
This text is ***bold and italics***.
```

This text is ***bold and italics***.

## Tables

Given that the editor supports some Markdown features, it is also possible to create tables in your notes.
This is done using standard Markdown table syntax.

The following, produces a 3x3 table

```
| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Something| Something| Something|
| Something| Something| Something|
| Something| Something| Something|
```

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Something| Something| Something|
| Something| Something| Something|
| Something| Something| Something|
