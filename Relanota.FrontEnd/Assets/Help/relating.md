# Relating Notes
---

Relanota allows the user to write notes that relates to each other.
This means if two notes share the same topic, they can be linked to each other.
This is done with Tags.

## What is a tag

A tag in Relanota, is used to link notes, and can contain a description of itself.
This description can be set in the **Tags** editor view, found in the navigation menu.
The description of a tag can be infinitely long, however only the first 100 characters will be shown in the Tags list.
When two notes share the same tag, they are linked to each other.
This means you can export both notes, when exporting based on the given tag.

## Creating a relation

If two notes share the same tag, these notes are now related.
Tags can be added to a note, directly from the note editor.
This is done in the tag bar, at the bottom right, of the note editor.
When typing in the tag bar, tags will be suggested to the user.
These tags are purely suggested based on the text provided to the tag box.
If you add a tag, that is not currently in the database, it will be created and associated with the note.
If the entered tag does exist in thed database, this tag will be associated with the note, and a relation will be created.

## Viewing related notes

Selecting the **Tags** editor, while a note is selected, allows you to see its tags.
Clicking one of these tags, will show which notes are related to this tag.

Selected the **Tags** editor while no note is selected, will show all tags.
Clicking one of these tags will also show which notes are related to the tag.
