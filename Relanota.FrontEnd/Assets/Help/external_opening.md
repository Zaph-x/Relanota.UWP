# Referencing Your Notes On External Sources

With Relanota, you are able to reference your notes from outside sources, such as websites or kanban boards.
This is done with the `note://` protocol.
Relanota assigns this protocol to itself, meaning you are able to open your notes from outside sources.

## How does it work

When editing a note, you are able to press `CTRL + L` to get a link to your note.
This link will be formatted with the desired action, as well as the name of the note.

#### Example

You are editing a note called `Probability in neural networks`.
You decide you want to reference this note on an external site or application.
You press `CTRL + L`.
The link gets copied to your clipboard and you are now able to paste it into the application or site of your choice.
The link will be `note://open/probability%20in%20neural%20networks`, and will open Relanota into the note specified.
